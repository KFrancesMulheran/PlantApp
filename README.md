# PlantApp

I'm currently working on an application that will recommend houseplants to a user based on a variety on inputs and preferences.
The user will have the option to save houseplants to a personal database.
There are also options to view a randomly selected plant from the database, or search by name for a particular plant.
Within the personal database, the user can view details and care instructions for their plants or delete unwanted plants.
I hope to add more functionality in the future, including a calender to help keep track of watering and fertilizing.

This app is primarily for use on mobile devices, and I'll be focusing my design strategy for smaller screens.
